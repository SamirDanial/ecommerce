# Email Verification Setup Guide

This guide explains how email verification works in your e-commerce application using Clerk authentication.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### 1. User Registration Flow
1. User signs up with email and password at `/register`
2. Clerk automatically sends a verification code to the user's email
3. User is redirected to `/register/verify-email-address`
4. User enters the verification code
5. Upon successful verification, user is redirected to the home page

### 2. Verification Process
- **Automatic Code Sending**: Clerk handles sending verification codes automatically
- **Code Input**: Users enter the 6-digit code in the verification page
- **Resend Functionality**: Users can request a new code if needed (with 60-second cooldown)
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for expired/invalid codes

## ðŸ”§ Clerk Configuration

### Required Webhook Events
Make sure these webhook events are enabled in your Clerk dashboard:

1. **`email_address.verified`** - Triggered when a user verifies their email
2. **`email_address.created`** - Triggered when a new email is added to a user
3. **`user.created`** - Triggered when a new user signs up
4. **`user.updated`** - Triggered when user data is updated

### Webhook URL
Set your webhook endpoint in Clerk dashboard:
```
https://your-domain.com/api/clerk/webhook
```

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your `.env` file:
```bash
REACT_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here
```

## ðŸ“± Frontend Components

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Verification code not received**
   - Check spam/junk folder
   - Verify email address is correct
   - Wait a few minutes for delivery
   - Use resend functionality if needed

2. **Webhook not working**
   - Verify webhook URL is correct in Clerk dashboard
   - Check webhook events are enabled
   - Monitor backend logs for errors
   - Ensure webhook endpoint is accessible

3. **Verification fails**
   - Check if code has expired
   - Ensure code is entered correctly
   - Verify user account status in Clerk

### Debug Mode
Enable Clerk debug mode in your `.env`:
```bash
REACT_APP_CLERK_DEBUG=true
```

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

### Webhook Verification
- Webhook signature verification is currently disabled for local testing
- **Enable signature verification in production** by uncommenting the verification code
- Use environment variables for webhook secrets

### Rate Limiting
- Resend functionality has a 60-second cooldown
- Consider implementing additional rate limiting for production

### Data Privacy
- Only necessary user data is stored
- Email verification status is tracked for security
- User data is synced securely with Clerk

## ðŸš€ Production Deployment

### Checklist
- [ ] Enable webhook signature verification
- [ ] Set production Clerk keys
- [ ] Configure production webhook URL
- [ ] Test verification flow in production
- [ ] Monitor webhook delivery and processing
- [ ] Set up error monitoring and logging

### Monitoring
- Monitor webhook delivery success rates
- Track email verification completion rates
- Log and alert on verification failures
- Monitor user signup completion rates
