# Shipping Rates Database Seeding

This document explains how to seed the shipping_rates table with comprehensive shipping rates for all countries in the world.

## Overview

The `seed-shipping-rates.ts` file populates the `ShippingRate` table with shipping costs and delivery times for **198 countries** worldwide, including:
- Country codes and names
- Shipping costs in USD

npx ts-node prisma/seed-shipping-rates.ts
```

### Option 3: Full database reset and seed
```bash
./reset-and-seed.sh
```

## What Gets Created

The seed file creates **198 shipping rates** with the following data structure:

```typescript
{
  countryCode: 'US',                    // ISO 2-letter country code
  countryName: 'United States',         // Full country name
  shippingCost: 0.00,                   // Shipping cost in USD
  deliveryDays: 3,                      // Estimated delivery time

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure Prisma is properly configured
2. Check that the database is running
3. Verify the schema matches the seed data structure
4. Run `npx prisma generate` if needed
5. Check for duplicate country codes

## Production Considerations

- **Update shipping costs regularly** based on market changes
- **Monitor delivery times** for accuracy
- **Implement regional shipping policies** for business rules
- **Add weight-based pricing** for different product types
- **Consider seasonal variations** in shipping costs
- **Integrate with shipping carriers** for real-time rates
- **Add shipping zone restrictions** if needed
- **Implement free shipping thresholds** for promotions
